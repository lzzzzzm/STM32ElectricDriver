# <center>  STM32 Projects Demo  </center>

## **Introduction**

This repo contains my demo projects when I learned how to use STM32 MCU, the projects is mainly based on the board of STM32F103, STM32F407 and STM32F429.

## **Inroduction of the demos**

The demo in this repo is not easily to transfer to other mcu, but it can be regarded as a demonstration when you learn the knowledge of its.

If the demo has some bugs, please pull issues to make me know !

**1. DC encoder motor(直流编码器电机)**

	This code develop on STM32F103

	A demonstration of how to use the DC encoder motor and utlize the data of encoder to control the speed and angle of motor with PID algorithm.
